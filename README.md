# Economic Impacts of COVID-19

## Project Summary

Significant efforts have been made towards modeling the spread of COVID-19 and understanding the factors that contribute to infections and deaths from the disease. However, the impact of the pandemic extends beyond public health into every aspect of society. In this project, we will study the economic impacts of COVID-19 in the United States. We will seek to understand how COVID-19 cases, deaths and testing numbers affect consumer spending, local business operations, and employment.
